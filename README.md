# cabbot

Pluggable bot for cabal.chat. See plugins directory for example plugins.

## Usage

After installing node/npm:
```shell
NICK=<bot_nickname> KEY=<key> npx cabbot
```

For example, for the public cabal chat on their homepage right now, they list:
> cabal://1fdc83d08699781...c12e4a9065ad

So you'd do:
```shell
NICK=cabbot KEY=1fdc83d08699781ad...e1507ecb18e47 npx cabbot
```
